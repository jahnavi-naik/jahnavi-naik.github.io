### Will Driver Accept the coupon?

I completed this project with a group in my CS105 class. We found the dataset through the UCI repository, cleaned the data, created visualizations to display different aspects of the data, and ran a K Nearest Neighbors Analysis, yeilding a model with 66% accuracy. All work was done using Python though Jupyter Notebook.
  
### Titanic Survival

This Kaggle competition was about creating a model that would determine if the passenger survived or not, using the given data. I used the given training set to train my Decision Trees model, and then used that model on the test, set, obtaining an accuracy score of 74%. I did this work using Python using a Jupyter notebook, and later uploaded it to Kaggle.

### Disney Plus Statistics

For this project, I wanted to practice creating visualizations in Tableu. To do this, I first found a dataset from Kaggle containing statistics about the Disney Plus streaming service. I then cleaned the data and removed any NaNs in python with a Jupityr notebook, and finally uploaded the clean data to Tableu where I created different visualizations about the trends.
