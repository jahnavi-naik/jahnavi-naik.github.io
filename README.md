### Will Driver Accept the coupon?
  I completed this project with a group in my CS105 class . We found the dataset through the UCI repository, cleaned the data, created visualizations to display different aspects of the data, and ran a K Nearest Neighbors Analysis, yeilding a model with 66% accuracy.
  
### Titanic Survival
  This Kaggle competition was about creating a model that would determine if the passenger survived or not, using the given data. I used the given training set to train my Decision Trees model, and then used that model on the test, set, obtaining an accuracy score of 74%.
