I completed this project with a group in my CS105 class. We found the dataset through the UCI repository, cleaned the data, created visualizations to display different aspects of the data, and ran a K Nearest Neighbors Analysis, yeilding a model with 66% accuracy. All work was done using Python though Jupiter Notebook.
  
### Titanic Survival

This Kaggle competition was about creating a model that would determine if the passenger survived or not, using the given data. I used the given training set to train my Decision Trees model, and then used that model on the test, set, obtaining an accuracy score of 74%. I did this work using Python using a Jupiter notebook, and later uploaded it to Kaggle.
